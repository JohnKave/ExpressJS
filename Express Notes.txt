Express Notes
-------------
- (a framework)"Express" js on "node" js for a restful API
- need node js and node package manager
- cmd >npm init (-y for default) where "npm init -y"
- "npm i express" to install express module
- node index.js to run at ide's terminal or command prompt
- "npm i -g nodemon" < install nodemon for realtime tracking in development (node monitor)
//add "sudo" on mac if permission property is not configured yet where ">sudo npm i -g nodemon"
-g for global

About Restful API for a beginner
--------------------------------

- API ( Application Programming Interface ) - connection between computers or between computer programs

- "REST" => most common communication standard between computers / A Common API standards

- mobile/web application ==use==> REST ==to==> talk to the server ( **A set of rules for building web API** )

- REST ==> REpresentational State Transfer 

- Restful API ==> API that follows REST standard/ an architectural style

REST principles
---------------
- Stateless, where each request is independent and must contain all the information needed for processing

- Resource-Based identification /users, /products

- use standard http methods

- resource representation in JSON or XML format

x--------------------------------------------------x

REST basics
-----------
- Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URI ) 

- URIs <== different types of resources "users"/"products" **(nouns)**

- Requests or HTTP verbs ==preceeds/use-to-get==> URIs (resources)

- HTTP verbs ==> POST/GET/PUT/DELETE (CRUD) // Requests

- Request's body ==could have==> custom payload of data (encoded in JSON) ("optional HTTP requests")

-* REST implementation should be stateless ( two parties don't need to store any information about each other "client" and "server" )

-* Every req/res independent from all others

- Versioning is important >>allows>> implementation to backward compatibility
(eg. prefix the version before the resource on the URI => "/v1/products" "/v2/products" )

x-----------------------------------------------------x

Process of RESTful API
----------------------

1.client req
2.server receives/process req
3.server response httpstatus + req/obj (GET/POST)

- httpstatus 
[ 200+(good/success), 400+(something went wrong with req/client level), 500+(server level error) ]

About APIs // Endpoints
-----------------------

Public APIs
-http end points like "https://market/resources/clothes/1"
-URL ( Uniform Resource Locator )

APIs with authentications
- ( curl -H "Authorization: token OAUTH-TOKEN" https://api.github.com )
- ( curl https://api.github.com/?access_token = OAUTH-TOKEN )
- ( curl 'https://api.github.com/users/whatever?client_id=xxxx&client_secret=yyyy' )

PUT and PATCH diff
------------------
PUT - Update the entire existing source
PATCH - update part of an existing source


xxx
TypeORM => Can Connect with Most of the databases
Mongoose => Only for Mongodb
xxx

Cookies
-------
/*note: the explanation will be basic-easy-to-understand.
...

/what are cookies?:
- text files with small pieces of data (eg. username, session ID)
- sent from the server to the user's browser
/after-process: browser stores the cookie and sends it back to the server when user request to the same domain as subsequent request
/purpose: to store user-specific information (eg. login sessions, preferences or items in a shopping cart.

/type of cookies:
- session cookies: temporary info storage/ removed after a session (browser closed)
- persistent cookies: long term info storage/ removed after set amount of time (eg. remembering login credentials )
- first-party cookies: set by visited website directly (user pref/sessions/etc...)
- third-party cookies: set by other parties (eg. ad/ networks/ usedFor: cross-site tracking/targeted advertising)

/How Cookies work
- USER ( visits a website ) --> SERVER --send--> "Set-Cookie" header in HTTP response
- BROWSER --saves--> cookie
- USER ( visits same website ): BROWSER --sends--> saved cookie --to--> SERVER /with "Cookie" header


Sample Cookies
--------------
From SERVER to BROWSER: " Set-Cookie: session_id=12345; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict
From BROWSER to SERVER: " Cookie: session_id=12345 "

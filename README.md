# ExpressJS
This is a repository for storing some notes and projects during the process of learning how to build a Restful API with Express JS.
Here, I will include notes related mainly about ExpressJS and Restful API basics that I've learned along the way.

Feel free to notify me about wrong stuffs in my notes as my knowledge is not perfect.
Feel free to use these resources as u see it fits.

Many of the projects that I upload here might not be of my own.
I give credits to whoever that i learned these projects from (Youtube, etc).
This is a repository for my ExpressJS training process as well.
And is also the first repository in my github account.
